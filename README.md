# Torrent Report

_work in progress_

A source for time series reports on the top and new torrent files.

Every 24 hours our site begins scraping the top torrents from a series of torrent sites. We identify unique torrents and store the count of seeders and leachers for every torrent.

We use puppeteer (the headless chrome utility) in our scraping.
